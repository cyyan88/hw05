This is a visualization of letters on a keyboard colored by how frequently they appear in 5 letter words used in Wordle. We can see that A, S, and E are the most commonly used letters. Q, Z, X, V, and J are the least frequently used. This visualization was based off the one created in [Coding Out Loud: Episode 4](https://dukecct.github.io/coding-out-loud/).
